# vmSystem

## About

A small, educational program meant to test-and-check students' understanding of
multi-level page systems, probably during a unit on virtual memory in a systems
course...

The main program is written in C, however there is also an unfinished shell
script that is supposed to do pretty much the same thing (written for zsh).

## Installing and building

Simply download this git repo to your local machine, and run:

```
cd vmSystem && make
```

This should generate an executable file called **vm**. To run it, do the
usual `./vm` or if you want to run the zshell script for some reason, run

```
chmod +x vm.sh
```
to give the file executable permissions, and then
```
zsh vm.sh
```

Note that this particular script may not be compatible with bash/other shells.
